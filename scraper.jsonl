  "text": [
    "Even in La La Land, where people live bathed in sunshine and Hollywood glamour, 2020 was a horrific year. The upending of normal life due to the coronavirus pandemic led people everywhere, including in this already lifestyle-obsessed city, to re-evaluate their homes and think about where and how they want to live.",
    "For many high-net-worth households in Los Angeles, the instinct was to double down on what they love about Southern California: a healthy lifestyle spent primarily outdoors. For many  people, that meant moving for more land rather than a bigger house. Those buyers want property for privacy and to create a private oasis for their family and friends. Other buyers want additional space so they can expand their indoor-outdoor layout or just want a new location with easier access to hiking, biking or the beach.",
    "\u201cThe outdoor lifestyle is why people pay to live in Los Angeles,\u201d said Cindy Ambuehl, a real estate agent with Compass in Los Angeles. \u201cMore than anything, they want to be able to breathe and to enjoy the gorgeous weather.\u201d",

    "\u201cSize matters and so does a layout that has room for everyone to get away from each other as well as to gather together,\u201d Mr. Kaminsky said.",
    "The pandemic-induced trend of wanting a house with several home offices, a gym, a screening room and a larger yard also created a shift in where people want to live in the city, said Michael Nourmand, president of Nourmand & Associates Realtors in Los Angeles.",
    "\u201cA few years ago, there was this idea that Los Angeles would become more dense, and there would be more vertical living downtown,\u201d he said. \u201cNow we\u2019re embracing the fact that we\u2019re not New York. We want horizontal living and to see the blue sky.\u201d",

    "Ms. Ambuehl said that her buyers are looking for one of two types of locations, both related to the desire to be outside.",
    "\u201cPeople want a home with more land and will even accept a smaller house with it, as long as every room opens to the outside,\u201d Ms. Ambuehl said. \u201cBuyers want a retreat and a lifestyle where they feel like they\u2019re away from everything.\u201d",

    "Los Angeles is known for its sprawl and its freeways, yet it also has many walkable communities. For example, beach communities such as Santa Monica and Manhattan Beach have shops and restaurants within walking distance of homes. Pacific Palisades has become more sought after since Palisades Village, a community of shops and restaurants, opened in 2018, said Ms. Ambuehl.",
    "\u201cLand is scarce in these neighborhoods, so anyone who wants a bigger lot will pay a high price for it,\u201d Ms. Ambueh said.",

    "Palos Verdes has become more popular than ever because of its larger homes and lots, said Mr. Kaminsky. He said buyers sometimes avoided that community because of its long commute into Los Angeles, which is less of a concern now that they can work at home most of the time.",
    "The lack of a commute is also driving luxury buyers to Malibu, Montecito, Santa Barbara and Palm Springs, said Mr. Nourmand. Many of those buyers are purchasing second homes in those locations along with a primary home in a gated community in Calabasas or Hidden Hills, in the Santa Monica Mountains near Los Angeles. ",

(Mansion Global is owned by Dow Jones. Both Dow Jones and realtor.com are owned by News Corp.) Mr. Kaminsky said Ojai, located in Ventura County between Los Angeles and Santa Barbara, is also getting more attention from luxury buyers because it offers plenty of acreage for those seeking privacy.",

    "Don't Count on Zillow's 'Zestimate' Price"
  ],
  "text": [
    "If you\u2019ve been doomscrolling your way to online real estate listings, dreaming of buying a home with more space and finding a lot that you can\u2019t afford, you\u2019re not alone. Searching Zillow has become a pandemic coping strategy for many, though rapidly rising sale prices are likely contributing to our anxiety rather than alleviating it. Nationally, home prices in December ",
    "increased 10.4%",
    " over the previous year.",
    "It\u2019s easy to get caught up in Zillow\u2019s automated home value estimates\u2014Zestimates\u2014when starting your (real or hypothetical) home search. But Zestimates don\u2019t often reflect what a home is actually worth, nor what it\u2019ll sell for in the end. ",
    "In some markets, like highly competitive Phoenix, ",
    "real estate agents have found",
    " that the Zestimate model tends to overvalue properties. On the flip side, the Zestimate doesn\u2019t matter at all if sellers are listing homes at higher prices and buyers are offering much more than that. ",
    "The Zestimate is Zillow\u2019s home valuation tool. It uses available data from public records as well as information about a home\u2019s features to approximate the value. Zestimates, when available, are included in property listings. ",
    "Here\u2019s ",
    "what the Zestimate considers",
    ": ",
    "Zillow acknowledges that its Zestimates are ",
    "not",
    " official appraisals and fall within a margin of error. The more data that\u2019s available for an area and a specific property, the more accurate the Zestimate. ",
    "However, the ",
    "median error rate",
    " for homes on the market is 1.9%, meaning only half of all Zestimates are within 2% of the selling price. The median error rate for off-market homes is 7.5%. The error rate is higher in some markets and lower in others. ",
    "The bottom line, though, is that a Zestimate could be thousands or tens of thousands of dollars off\u2014and it\u2019s not the same as the sale price. What this means is that you shouldn\u2019t take Zillow\u2019s Zestimate as gospel, whether you\u2019re buying or selling, but instead it can be helpful to have a real estate agent who can give you a more specific analysis of your market and determine what\u2019s over- and underpriced."

    "Questions to Ask Your Realtor When Selling Your Home"
  ],
  "text": [
    "With home prices up ",
    "pretty much everywhere",
    ", you may have decided to sell your home. To get the most out of your property, you\u2019ll need to hire a good real estate agent who knows how to price a property, market it, and negotiate effectively. To find the right agent, you\u2019ll need to ask the right questions\u2014like the ones below. ",
    "You can find an agent by researching local agents online, or through the ",
    "Find a Realtor",
    " search tool, but most commonly home sellers find an agent through their own personal network (40% according to the ",
    "National Association of Realtors",
    "\u00a0",
    "). Of course, even a referral from someone you trust should be taken with a grain to salt. You\u2019ll want to schedule an interview with any prospective agent and ask them the following questions:",
    "Knowledge is confidence. Make sure your agent is licensed by your state and has met the minimum levels of education, training, and testing. Also,",
    " ask if they\u2019re a realtor, a designation which means they\u2019ve had additional training and follow a strict code of ethics as members of the ",
    "National Association of Realtors",
    " (roughly 50% of the agents are realtors). The organization also has ",
    "all sorts of impressive certifications",
    " that your realtor might have, including the highest certification,",
    " known as the Certified Residential Specialist (held by about 4% of Realtors nationwide). A \u201cbroker\u201d is another designation that comes with more education (it gives a realtor the power to oversee ordinary agents).",
    "Ideally, you\u2019ll want an agent with some experience. Look for at least three years of experience selling residential real estate, particularly homes like yours. As home selling is a legal process with many moving parts in a limited time frame, an experienced agent will have a better sense of the possible pitfalls (like changing market conditions or failed inspections) and how to deal with them calmly.",
    "The trade-off here is that you will likely pay for that experience through higher commission fees (6% is the ",
    "national average",
    "). You might be able to negotiate a lower commission rate with a less experienced agent, but that will carry some additional risk. But that doesn\u2019t mean they aren\u2019t a rising star, either. You\u2019ll want to ask about their track record, which leads",
    " to our",
    " next question:",
    "Ask your prospective agent for the listing and sales dates of their most recent transactions; y",
    "ou\u2019re looking for completed sales within a couple of months, not homes that take months or years to sell (especially in a good market). A good agent should have a strong handle on what your home is worth. Ask about their ",
    "average list to sale price ratio",
    ": over 100% means that your agent is consistently selling homes above the list price, which is what you can expect from a top-",
    "selling agent. The list-",
    "to-",
    "price ratio has its limits, however\u2014market valuation is not an exact science,",
    " and even a good agents can post a list price that turns out to be slightly overvalued. But as a rule of thumb, an average ratio below 100% tells you that your agent is consistently selling homes for less than the listed price.",
    "After saving up for a long time, I recently bought a home, which caught some of my friends off\u2026",
    "You don\u2019t want to hire an agent just because they suggest the highest list price. Your agent\u2019s job is to assess your home\u2019s worth ",
    "accurately",
    " using recent market data and apples-to-apples comparisons of similar homes recently sold. They should be able to explain their thought process and make a convincing case for their price point, using concrete examples. You\u2019ll also want an agent that knows your local area inside and out.",
    "When hired, your agent will place your home on a home listing database called the Multiple Listing Service (MLS), schedule open houses,",
    " or otherwise arrange for buyers to visit your property. But that\u2019s just the bare minimum. Your prospective agent should be able to offer a blend of both offline and online marketing. They should be able to produce high-quality images of your house, both video and photos; promote your property on social media accounts (Facebook, Y",
    "ouT",
    "ube, Twitter); and print high-quality glossy brochures (especially for an open house). A good agent will have good ideas for staging and able to suggest a professional stager if you agree that it\u2019s needed.",
    "An interview will help you determine whether your realtor is the right fit for you. You want an agent that is patient, objective, and resourceful. If you feel like they are pressuring you to hire them, walk away. ",
    "What are other good questions you might ask a prospective agent? Let us know in the comments. "

    "Why the Rent vs. Buy Debate Is Completely Pointless"
  ],
  "text": [
    "After saving up for a long time, I recently bought a home, which caught some of my friends off guard. \u201cI thought you were anti-homeownership,\u201d they said, because I think renting is underrated. Even as a homeowner, I ",
    "still",
    " think renting is underrated. But that doesn\u2019t mean buying is a bad decision. The rent vs. buy debate is just silly overall, and ignores the enormous grey area that exists between the two options.",
    "For years, buying a home was a measure of financial success. The housing crisis flipped that idea on its head, though, and people realized buying isn\u2019t always smart. In fact, I\u2019ve recently come across quite a few articles (",
    "or headlines, at least",
    ") that actually proclaim ",
    "buying a home is a stupid decision.",
    " If you dig into the meat of those articles, they explain that, sure, buying a home ",
    "can",
    " be a good decision, but their headlines sum up the takeaway: buying a home is a dumb money move that sounds smart.",
    "We\u2019ve oversold the dream of homeownership for years, but now it seems like we\u2019re taking it to the other extreme. So how did we go from years of believing homeownership is a smart financial move, to now believing it\u2019s one of the worst financial moves you can make? To address the question, it helps to see ",
    "both sides of the argument",
    ".",
    "You\u2019re out of debt, and you\u2019ve start funneling your money toward your next big financial goal:\u2026",
    "Strong arguments in favor of buying are usually:",
    "And the equally solid arguments in favor of renting:",
    "All of these points are valid, and I considered them in my own decision, too. The thing is, though, there\u2019s a ",
    "huge",
    " amount of grey area\u2014individual factors\u2014 in all of them, so it doesn\u2019t make sense to assert that either decision is the best decision. These factors are important, but the debate that comes with them is useless because the answer hinges on specifics: rent prices, interest rates, and so on. Buying a home can indeed be a bad financial move, but for many people, it isn\u2019t.",
    "In other words, neither option is inherently smart or dumb, despite what traditional thinking and headlines will have you believe. It comes down to crunching some numbers, perhaps changing the way you think about homeownership, and protecting your finances.",
    "When you buy a home, you pay for things you don\u2019t have to pay for as a renter: loan interest, property taxes, insurance, and even maintenance and repair costs. That\u2019s part of the argument in favor of renting: there are so many additional costs and factors that get overlooked. That goes for both sides, though, and the details vary depending on the situation. Here are a few ",
    "commonly overlooked factors",
    " that make up the specifics.",
    "When popular myths get debunked, people often throw the baby out with the bathwater. Buying a home\u2026",
    "These are just a few factors, and they\u2019re still far from conclusive in either direction. There are lots of caveats to consider. For example, opportunity cost is great, but are you actually going to invest that money, or just hoard it in your low-interest checking account? If you don\u2019t earn a return, the point is moot.",
    "It\u2019s impossible to say renting or buying is a better decision for everyone because each one of these factors (and more) depends on your unique situation. You have to consider where you live, what kind of house you\u2019re looking for, how much you pay in rent, how much you\u2019ll pay in the future...the list goes on and on.",
    "The ",
    "New York Times Rent vs. Buy calculator",
    " is, hands down, the best we\u2019ve seen for simplifying these complexities, depending on your own individual specifics. Still, a calculator can only do so much. It might tell you the better long-term decision on paper, but that still doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s the best decision for ",
    "you",
    ".",
    "The hidden costs of homebuying aren\u2019t secrets, per se\u2014they\u2019re expenses that are hard to predict if\u2026",
    "For example, when my fianc\u00e9 and I crunched the numbers a few years ago, the calculator told us that buying was better if our rent was over $1,500 per month. At that point, our rent was $1,600, so technically, buying would have made more sense on paper. However, our down payment would have been less than 10%, and aside from a small emergency fund, we didn\u2019t have much in savings. If one of us lost our job, we\u2019d have trouble paying the mortgage. All of that was enough to postpone buying, despite what the calculator said.",
    "The point is: As much as it does come down to the numbers, there\u2019s ",
    "still",
    " more that goes into the decision. You have to consider affordability.",
    "Most experts agree that you shouldn\u2019t think of your primary home as an investment. Contrary to popular belief, ",
    "real estate barely outpaces inflation",
    " over time. Sure, you could time the market, flip a house, or buy a rental, but that\u2019s different from expecting your primary home to earn you a sweet return. The investing myth is another valid argument against buying. Many people buy homes they can\u2019t afford or stretch their finances to pay for expensive home projects ",
    "because they buy into this myth",
    ".",
    "Experts agree that buying can be a bad investment, but the problem is, many misinterpret this to mean ",
    "buying a home is a bad idea in general",
    ". Just because your home isn\u2019t a great ",
    "investment",
    " doesn\u2019t necessarily make it a bad ",
    "purchase",
    ".",
    "With any purchase, there\u2019s the matter of individual affordability. Most people are familiar with the ",
    "20% rule for buying a home",
    ". Whether you put down that exact amount or not, you should avoid buying a house you can\u2019t afford to keep. How do you define \u201caffordable,\u201d though? This is where rules of thumb come in handy. It may seem contradictory to suggest ballpark rules when we\u2019ve been talking about taking your individual case into account, but they give you some smart guidelines to follow.",
    "Could you stand living with your parents for a bit longer if it meant saving up more for a down\u2026",
    "For example, the ",
    "25% rule",
    ", which says your housing costs shouldn\u2019t be more than 25% of your take-home pay, is good for that. It\u2019s not just your monthly payment, though; you also want to make sure you have enough cash in reserves in case of an emergency. In other words, don\u2019t be \u201chouse poor.\u201d",
    "Of course, there\u2019s the emotional aspect, or the American Dream, of homeownership. However, if the numbers don\u2019t add up, and you\u2019re going to be house poor, buying a home ",
    "for the sake of owning",
    " is pretty pointless. The sense of satisfaction you get from owning is kind of offset by the risk of losing it to the bank. If the numbers ",
    "do",
    " add up, however, and your monthly mortgage payment isn\u2019t going to financially ruin you, that\u2019s a different story.",
    "The bottom line is: sometimes it\u2019s smarter to rent, and sometimes buying can work in your favor. Rather than giving in to one side or another, it\u2019s more helpful to learn the rules, crunch the numbers, then do what works\u2014and feels right\u2014for you.",
